Attempt to get back into C/C++ programming

Growing up I started programming with C/C++ language. Across the last decade I've only been a Java programmer. Recently I came across my old copy of Ivor Horton's Beginning C++. Now I'm starting this repo as I go through Ivor's textbook once more. :)

# Getting Started
## Install g++ compiler
I'm using Linux Mint for this project. When trying to install g++ compiler there were some errors. Found the following link that showed how to install g++. [http://superuser.com/questions/772954/install-gcc-g-version-4-9-in-linux-mint](http://superuser.com/questions/772954/install-gcc-g-version-4-9-in-linux-mint).
Here are the commands I used based on that link, but I did used the `-4.9` portion:
```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++
```
